# Raspyn - Simplifying Speed

## Overview
Raspyn is a modern network protocol designed to deliver high-speed, efficient, and reliable data transfer. It aims to simplify network communication while maximizing performance. This repository contains the implementation of Raspyn, along with comprehensive documentation and examples to help you get started.

## Features
- **Lightning Fast:** Optimized for minimal latency and maximum throughput.
- **Simple API:** Easy to implement and use, with a clean and intuitive interface.
- **Robust Reliability:** Ensures data integrity and seamless connectivity, even in demanding environments.
- **Built-in Security:** Advanced security features to protect your data during transmission.

## Technologies Used
- **C Programming Language:** The core implementation of Raspyn is written in C, providing low-level control and high performance.
- **Sockets API:** Utilizes the Berkeley sockets API for network communication.
- **Makefile:** For build automation, ensuring easy compilation and linking of the source code.
- **Doxygen:** For generating comprehensive and easy-to-navigate documentation.


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **C Compiler:** GCC or Clang is recommended.
- **Make:** For build automation.
- **Doxygen:** (Optional) For generating documentation from source code comments.

### Installation
1. **Clone the Repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/raspyn.git
    cd raspyn
    ```

2. **Build the Project:**
    ```sh
    make
    ```

3. **Run the Server:**
    ```sh
    ./server
    ```

4. **Run the Client:**
    ```sh
    ./client
    ```

### Usage
Raspyn includes a simple example to demonstrate how to use the protocol for communication between a client and a server.

# Server

The server listens for incoming connections and processes messages using the Raspyn protocol.

## Example

```c
#include "raspyn.h"

int main() {
    raspyn_server_t server;
    raspyn_init_server(&server, "127.0.0.1", 12345);
    raspyn_run_server(&server);
    return 0;
}
```

# Client

The client connects to the server and sends a message using the Raspyn protocol.

## Example

```c
#include "raspyn.h"

int main() {
    raspyn_client_t client;
    raspyn_init_client(&client, "127.0.0.1", 12345);
    raspyn_send_message(&client, "Hello, Raspyn!");
    raspyn_receive_message(&client);
    return 0;
}
```
